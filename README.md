**The Chord Progression Formula**

> What if you wanted to come up with more chord progressions? There is actually a theoretical formula for doing this, which you can tap into in the event you need some structure > to get going. First, settle on a key, then find the major scale in that key. Let’s take the key of C for example.

**Here’s your scale:**
* C - D - E - F - G - A - B

> Chord progressions can be built from scales because each note in the scale is a scale degree. Thus, 
> **you could also write the major scale like this:**
* I - ii - iii - IV - V - vi - vii°

**Each degree then holds the following titles respectively:**
> * Tonic (i)
> * Supertonic (ii)
> * Mediant (iii)
> * Subdominant (IV)
> * Dominant (V)
> * Submediant (vi)
> * Leading tone (vii°)

**You can then use the following diagram to plan out your progression:**

**It might look confusing, but let’s go through it step by step.**

# Creating your own chord progressions one step at a time
**Here's how you'd follow the chord progression diagram:**
* Start with your root note, in this case C which would be the tonic, thus I.
* From there you can go to any scale degree, so let’s try IV.
* From there we can go to either V or vii°. Let’s go with V.
* Notice that the tonic could go to any chord which means you could have followed it with a different note than IV. 
* If we had chosen iii instead, it would have then moved to vi and then had a choice between ii or IV.
* You would continue to follow the diagram until it resolved back to the tonic chord. 

**From our three steps above we end up with the following progression:**
* I - IV - V or Tonic - Subdominant - Dominant

> Now, if we plug that back into the C major scale, 
**we get the following chord progression:**
* C - F - G

> And this can be easily transposed to any scale. 
**Take the E major scale for example:**
* E - F♯ - G♯ - A - B - C♯

**If you apply the progression**
* I - IV - V 

**you get the following:** 
* E - A - B.

This way you can start to see how we get some of these more common and oft-used chord progressions.
